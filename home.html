    <p><i>"kind of moody and obsessed with anything cute. falling in love with one of kanade's songs found at random online, mizuki created a music video for it, which in turn caught kanade's attention. that's how mizuki became the group's animator. friends though they may be, mizuki keeps a big secret from the rest of the group."</i></p>

    <h1>who is mizuki?</h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">mizuki akiyama is a character from <a href="https://pjsekai.sega.jp/" target=”_blank”>project sekai</a>, a vocaloid rhythm game. mizuki is a first year student at kamiyama high school. they're the animator of the underground music circle <a href="https://sekai.best/unit/school_refusal" target=”_blank”>nightcord at 25:00</a>, going by the alias "amia".</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">since junior high, mizuki was treated as an outcast for dressing and acting oddly. mizuki expresses confusion over their criticism, seeing nothing wrong with wanting to dress cute. it's implied they do not attend school regularly due to the negative attention from their classmates. because of this reputation, mizuki spent their time on the rooftop, where they met <a href="https://sekai.best/chara/16" target=”_blank”>rui</a>, one of their only friends before becoming part of nightcord. mizuki's older sister is a fashion designer living overseas, and inspired mizuki's love of fashion.</p>
    <img src="media/mizuki_hip2.png" style="width:40%; float:right;">
    <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>mizuki's gender identity is officially unknown</b>. due to this status as well as their story throughout the game, many fans headcanon mizuki as nonbinary or transfem. personally, i see mizuki as an intersex transfem and use they/them pronouns for them. this headcanon is very important to me as an intersex person who relates to mizuki's circumstances.</p>
